## Problème
Our project makes information easy to obtain, and will keep blockchain users updated on everything based on what they are searching for. It'll be easier for beginner and more experienced users to make decisions by following successfull investissors they have interests in.

## Solution
We solved our problem by creating a no code automatisation platform <br />
To achieve this we used React, Express, and MariaDB. Our biggest technical challenge was to implement the login with MetaMask, we worked really hard all together and succeeded.

## Installation
You will find in the repository 2 folders : frontend & backend.<br />
You need to create a .env with many API keys in the backend folder documented into an `.env.example`file, so instead, we found more easy to deploy our solution on a publicy available website.<br />

Go in each folder in order to launch `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
If everything is set as it should, you will be welcomed on our solution and you will be able to connect with your metamask wallet.


## Équipe et commentaires
Our name is Snitcher. We learned how to use React and Express, and we took a lot of time to understand how MetaMask and the web3 worked, at the end of these two days we now have knowloedge on all of these things !
