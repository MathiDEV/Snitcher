## Problem

Our project makes information **easy to obtain**, and will keep blockchain users updated on everything based on what they are searching for. It'll be easier for beginner and more experienced users to make decisions by following **successfull investissors** they have interests in.

## Solution
We solved our problem by creating a no code automatisation platform.

To achieve this, we used React, Express, MariaDB and oviously the **Starton API**. Our biggest technical challenge was to implement the login with MetaMask, we worked really hard all together and **succeeded.**

The simplicity of the **Starton API** integration has undoubtedly saved us precious hours.

## Installation

An automation project like this communicates with many APIs, some paid (at our expense üòÑ).

However, it is impossible for us to push the list of these keys to this GitHub directory. On the other hand, **we hosted the site online:** [Snitcher](https://snitcher.socialeo.net).

If despite everything you want to try this project on your side :

You'll find in the repository **2 folders:** frontend & backend.

You'll need to create a .env with all your API keys in the backend folder documented into the `Backend/.env.example` file.

Go into each folder in order to launch `npm install` and then `npm start`.

If everything is set as it should, you will be welcomed on our solution and you will be able to connect with your Metamask wallet.

## Team and comments

Our name is **Snitcher**, because our application will whatch for everything happening on the blockchain and **snitch** it to you via the means of communication of **your choice**.

We learned how to use React and Express _(we mastered PhP better, but we wanted to add a little challenge)_, and we took a lot of time to understand how MetaMask and the web3 works, at the end of these two days we now have knowloedge on all of these things!

‚ù§Ô∏è I repeat it but we are very proud to have been able to work on a project around the Starton API which perfectly met the needs of our application, whether for the search for wallets or for the automation of tasks!
